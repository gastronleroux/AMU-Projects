## AMU Projects

Math and IT related projects for university merged together in form of a web app. Created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## Live preview

You can access the live preview version of the project [here](https://gastronleroux.github.io/AMU-Projects/).

## Installation and Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open 'index.html' in your browser

## App Usage

Initial menu lets you choose 1 of 3 projects:
1. Markov Chains based on Covid-19  
The app allows you to simulate a random walk in a Markov Chain based on Covid-19. The user is able to adjust the age and the comorbidities boolean of the variable and create a transition matrix based on those data to finally observe the process of changes of states trough the simulation. [More about Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).
2. Darboux's principle  
The app finds the zero of a given function in a given range based on the Darboux property: A continuous function on the interval [a, b] and such that f(a) < 0 and f(b) > 0 has a root in the interval (a, b).
3. Analysing formulas in terms of tautology  
The app allows creating a truth table out of a given formula in search for a tautology. [More about tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic))
